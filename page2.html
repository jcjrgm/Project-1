		<h2>Gardening</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Gardening is a wonderful hobby that anyone can take up on. It's great exercise as you are outside and constantly working with your hands as you care for your plants. It can be a great skill to learn how to grow your own fruits and vegetables so you can source your own food. It is also a great stress reliever as it is nice to just relax and focus on caring for your plants. The best part about gardening is that there is so much information available for you to properly get started on planting.</p>

		<h2>Cooking</h2>
        <div>
			<p>Cooking is a useful skill but also a fun experience. Trying to teach yourself how to cook new recipes can open your horizons when it comes to your culinary skills. There are many different dishes that require different techniques or methods to bring out the flavor. By trying your hand at cooking different meals, you can learn so much and gain skills that can carry over to the rest of your cooking. Not to mention you'll become better at feeding yourself good food.</p>
		</div>
			
		<h2>Video Games</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Video games are a relatively new form of media that I feel are often overlooked as nothing more than just games. I've read and listened to many intriguing bits of dialogue that can be very thought-provoking. I've seen many landscapes and character designs that are beautiful and artistic. I've listened to music that actually makes me feel different emotions. All of this I've experienced in many video games. I truly wish video games were seen as equals to film and literature.</p>
